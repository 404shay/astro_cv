During my time at Mailchimp, I frequently handled issues related to trust & safety, compromised accounts, phishing campaigns, social engineering, and spoofing. When the COVID-19 pandemic began, these problems rapidly evolved. 

To build on this professional experience and gain a deeper understanding of the changing security landscape, I completed a 6-month Cybersecurity course through Georgia Tech's Professional Education division.
